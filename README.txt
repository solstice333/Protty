Installing NumPy and BioPython (Python 2.7 is installed by default 
on Mac OS X):

1. Open up a Terminal
2. Type in

   cd Dropbox/<our shared folder>/protty

where <our shared folder> is replaced with the actual name
of our shared folder (I think it's "From Kevin"). Note that
if <our shared folder> has spaces, then double quotes surrounding
<our shared folder> is needed. For example, if it really is
"From Kevin" then

   cd Dropbox/"From Kevin"/protty

is what you would type.

3. Run

   ./install.py
